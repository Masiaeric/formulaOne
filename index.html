            <h2>About Formula One</h2>
            <p>Formula One (also known as Formula 1 or F1) is the highest class of international auto racing 
                for single-seater formula racing cars sanctioned by the
                 Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA). The World Drivers' Championship,
                  which became the FIA Formula One World Championship in 1981, 
                  has been one of the premier forms of racing around the world since its inaugural season in 1950. 
                  The word formula in the name refers to the set of rules to which all
                   participants' cars must conform.[1] A Formula One season consists of a series of races,
                    known as Grands Prix, which take place worldwide on both purpose-built circuits 
                    and closed public roads.</p>
            <p>The results of each race are evaluated using a points system to determine two annual
                 World Championships: one for drivers, the other for constructors.
                  Each driver must hold a valid Super Licence,
                   the highest class of racing licence issued by the FIA.
                   [2] The races must run on tracks graded "1" (formerly "A"),
                    the highest grade-rating issued by the FIA.[2] 
                    Most events occur in rural locations on purpose-built tracks,
                     but several events take place on city streets.</p>

                         <h2>History</h2>
                         <p>The Formula One series originated with the European Championship of Grand Prix motor racing
                              (q.v. for pre-1947 history) of the 1920s and 1930s. 
                              The formula consists of a set of rules that all participants' cars must meet.
                               Formula One was a new formula agreed upon during 1946 after World War II,
                                with the first non-championship races taking place that year. 
                                The first Formula 1 race was the 1946 Turin Grand Prix.
                                 A number of Grand Prix racing organisations had laid out rules for a world championship before the war,
                                  but due to the suspension of racing during the conflict, the World Drivers'
                                   Championship did not become formalised until 1947.
                                    The first world championship race took place at Silverstone in the United Kingdom in 1950. 
                                    A championship for constructors followed in 1958. National championships existed in South Africa
                                     and the UK in the 1960s and 1970s. 
                                     Non-championship Formula One events were held by promoters for many years,
                                      but due to the increasing cost of competition, the last of these occurred in 1983.[10]</p>
                         <p>After a hiatus in European motor racing brought about by the outbreak of World War II in Europe in 1939,
                              the Italian Giuseppe Farina in his Alfa Romeo won the first World Championship for Drivers in 1950,
                               narrowly defeating his Argentine teammate Juan Manuel Fangio. However, Fangio won the title in 1951,
                                1954, 1955, 1956, and 1957 (his record of five World Championship titles stood for 45 years until
                                 German driver Michael Schumacher took his sixth title in 2003). Fangio's streak was interrupted
                                  (after an injury) by two-time champion Alberto Ascari of Ferrari. Although the UK's Stirling Moss
                                   was able to compete regularly, he was never able to win the world championship and is now widely 
                                   considered[by whom?] statistically to be the greatest driver never to have won the title.
                                    In a seven-year span between 1955 and 1961,
                                     Moss finished as championship runner-up four times and in third place the other three times.[11][12] Fangio, however, has a reputation for dominating Formula One's first decade and has long been considered[by whom?] the "Grand Master" of Formula One.</p>
